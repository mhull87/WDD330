   <h1>Week 1 Notes</h1> 
   <p>When you want to get the user’s input from any input or text area
    tag, you use the special word ‘value.’ When you want to show
    something to a user, you use a section (see Section 1) and the special
    word ‘innerHTML.’ So...if your dealing with an input or textarea
    use value; a section, use innerHTML.</p>

    <p>Using JavaScript you can store any information
        you want to use later. Even if your user refreshes the page or
        goes to some other site and then comes back, anything you’ve
        saved will still be there.</p>

        <h2>Questions</h2>
        <p>Where is this local storage and how does it save? How long does it save?</p>
