    <h1>Week 1 Notes</h1>
    <h2>Readings</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>When you want to get the user’s input from any input or text area
            tag, you use the special word ‘value.’ When you want to show
            something to a user, you use a section (see Section 1) and the special
            word ‘innerHTML.’ So...if your dealing with an input or textarea
            use value; a section, use innerHTML.</li>

        <li>Using JavaScript you can store any information
            you want to use later. Even if your user refreshes the page or
            goes to some other site and then comes back, anything you’ve
            saved will still be there.</li>
